## Description
A simple react web application using the Material UI CSS styling Library to showcase my ability to DISTL utilising clean code practices.

## Approach
I decided to keep the html the exact same except for refactoring strong into the makeBold class within the Material UI useStyles hook.  Everything was broken down into components based on the content between each opening and closing div tag.

Due to the nature of each component I would be too complex and time consuming to create template components to pass the provided html information into due to the structure and setup of each div section of the page.  For more complex and repetitive segments I would strive to create templates to then pass the wanted information into.  You will be able to see examples of this in my React Portfolio and RPG-Planner code files.

After this the Material UI Library was installed as I find it easier using the styling Library as it allows modified CSS as an object inside the same file of the component you wish to modify.
